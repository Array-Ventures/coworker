## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

To report a vulnerability, email the maintainers directly. You can find contact information in the repository profile or reach out via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- Work toward a fix and coordinated disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters in release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
